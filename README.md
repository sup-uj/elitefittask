Task Management Application
A simple and efficient Task Management Application built with React and Vite. The app allows users to organize their daily tasks, set priorities, and stay on top of deadlines with features like categorization, search, and filtering. Task data is stored in the browser using Local Storage, ensuring persistence without requiring user accounts.

Features

Upcoming Tasks: Tasks with future deadlines.
Overdue Tasks: Tasks past their due dates but incomplete.
Completed Tasks: Tasks marked as done.
2. Task Management
Add Tasks: Include title, description, due date, and priority level (High, Medium, Low).
Edit Tasks: Update task details as needed.
Delete Tasks: Remove tasks permanently.
3. Priority Levels
Assign tasks a priority level to help users focus:
High Priority
Medium Priority
Low Priority
4. Search and Filter
Search: Quickly find tasks by title.
Filter: View tasks by priority or completion status.
5. Local Storage Integration
Task data is stored locally in the browser, ensuring data persistence without requiring backend integration.
